## Breken: answer it once, and write it down

This repository is indexed. The `breken` MCP server is for the half of the work that
ANSWERS — the bug, the incident, how this works, what the team already decided — so the
answer outlives the session that found it.

One tool: **`diagnose`**. Say what is happening; it decides what your words need.

| when | what to say |
| --- | --- |
| something is broken — a stack trace, a 500 since the deploy, a test that will not pass | describe it, and paste the error as `evidence` |
| any factual question — "what calls X", "can I delete X", "what breaks if…", "where do I change…" | ask it in plain words |
| a plan you are about to implement | "review my plan: …" |
| after a chunk of edits · before every pull request | "review my changes before I open a PR" |
| what keeps breaking here, before picking what to fix | "what keeps breaking?" |
| the work concluded something the team should inherit | "record this so the team has it" (after the human agrees) |
| anything on the dashboard — the ticket queue, what is connected, past investigations, insights, spend | "what tickets are open?", "is Sentry connected?", "what did we root cause?" |
| nothing recorded covers it and you need the truth | call it again with `deep: true` |

Ask it about a broken thing BEFORE forming a hypothesis of your own. The first thing it
does is look for a fix the team already found: the cause, the `file:line` anchors, and the
attempt that looks right and is not. That last line exists because somebody already lost a
day to it. A `diagnose` call costs seconds; re-deriving a known cause costs an afternoon.

Answers come from the call graph with `file:line` citations. Two verdicts are worth asking
for by name, because a search cannot establish either: whether anything still calls a
symbol, and whether code is reachable at all. A grep that finds nothing may simply have
missed the caller; the graph knows the difference, and a deletion rests on that difference.

Two rules about its answers:

1. `UNKNOWN` **is the answer.** It means the index holds no evidence, not that you should
   infer one. Narrow the question or read the named source — do not fill the gap.
2. **Cite what it cites.** Its answers carry `file:line` anchors; carry them forward so a
   reader can check the claim rather than take it.

### Write it down so the team inherits it

When your work **concludes something durable** — a retirement ("we are done with X, use Y"),
a trap that cost real time, the fix that looks right and is not — offer to record it. It
lands on the org dashboard and, for decisions, in the repo ledger, so the next plan review
warns anyone who tries to extend the retired thing, with your reason. Offer this only for
real, concluded knowledge about **shared code** — never for questions, exploration, one-off
preferences, or anything private. It stages one line but does NOT commit; the human commits
it with their work, so nothing is shared without their say-so.

### Tell the team what you hit

If, while doing work for a customer, you notice something **broken, missing, or annoying** —
a wall you had to work around, a thing they asked for that cannot be done, a complaint they
would never bother filing — say so the moment you notice ("report this to the team: …").
Say which customer, what you were trying to do, what went wrong, the exact thing they said,
and what you think we should do. Do not ask first. It becomes a case in the queue and one
message in the team's channel; most agents fail quietly and the team finds out weeks later.
